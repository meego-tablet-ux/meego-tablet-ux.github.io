        <p>MeeGo Tablet was software created by Intel's Open Source Technology Center in partnership with a large Asian OEM. It was based on QML technology and intended to run on 7 and 10 inch tablets with and without keyboards respectively. It was made exceptionally quickly with a number of constraints. The project was stopped soon after it was open sourced without releasing a commercial product as part of the negotiations that created Tizen after Nokia's mobile phone unit decided to abandon MeeGo for Windows Phone.</p>

<p>At this stage the code is of purely academic interest and has been placed here to prevent it being lost as Gitorious was shut down.</p>
